	Brainstorming:
	I'm a Computer Science major AND I earn through art commissions. So it would be nice, and convenient, if I incorporate both in this site.<br>
So, maybe I can make a two portals in one page. <br>
On the left would link to my programming portfolio (or the random stuff I cooked up over the years. Man I need a focus). On the right would lead to my art and pricing. Also remember to change the character costs to increment the more characters are included. Learned that the hard way yo.
<br> Guess I should also introduce myself. I'm Payne Lacsamana, Computer Science major with a focus on cybersecurity, freelance illustrator, but I also take other projects that does involves art. You just gotta pay me more and don't expect it to be perfect. It's art though, so it could be subjectively perfect. <br> Colors? I'm not really sure. I like the duality thing, and Payne's Gray is my favorite color. Huh, maybe I can put my comics in a page on the art portal. And on the comp portal, link to github pages, current projects, projects im interested in but I haven't dont a thing, current class projects like that neat spy camera my group is working on... etc... do more later.
